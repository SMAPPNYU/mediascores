# Measuring Political Ideology with Link-Sharing Data: The mediascores library in R  

This library provides an R implementation of the statistical model introduced in "[News Sharing on Social Media: Mapping the Ideology of News Media, Politicians, and the Mass Public](https://gregoryeady.com/Papers/News_Sharing_on_Social_Media.pdf)" (Eady et al., Forthcoming).  

A software vignette with instructions for installation and usage of the library can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SMAPPNYU/mediascores/blob/master/vignettes/mediascores-vignette.html)
